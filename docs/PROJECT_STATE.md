# Project state

Baseline: 2026-09-13. Phase 11 complete (2026-09-14).

## Active state

- Current phase: 11 — Homework assignments and individual completion — COMPLETE; acceptance gate satisfied.
- Delivered: shared assignments with frozen recipient/class/date attribution, independent content/outcome correction chains, configurable mapped completion states, explicit No homework/Excused exceptions, due-date contextual single-slot reporting, overdue checklist, paged teacher workflows and read-only guardian history/current status.
- Evidence: prerequisite exams 7/7; final homework PostgreSQL 8/8; focused learning/exam/attendance/migration regression 22/22; unit 56/56; English/Egyptian Arabic DOM/HTTP 2/2 with RTL/axe and no HTTP 5xx; workspace typecheck/lint/build and diff check passed. Exact commands and interim fixes in HOMEWORK.md/HANDOFF.md.
- Migration/defaults: 0009 immutable homework adapter tables, no historical checkpoint reseed/meaning changes or role grants. Fresh isolated migration 0000–0009 applied and rerun idempotently; upgrade regression preserves identity/reservations/edited roles. D37 and API/DAILY_LEARNING document exact contracts/due semantics.
- Runtime: pinned Node 24.19.0/npm 11.1.0, isolated PostgreSQL 18.6 at loopback 55411. Disposable cluster stopped; no live data/service, environment file, dependency/model, deployment, browser automation or subagent changes. Initial diff clean, all phase work uncommitted.
- Limits: reviewed publications/rosters bounded to 100 children with further roster pages; classroom assignment list bounded to 100, parent history paged. Published date/recipient edits are unavailable (content correction only). Existing >500 kB build warning and prior authentication DOM timing defect remain, no production performance/manual visual/live delivery claim.
- Last completed phase: 11. Next: Phase 12 — Parent hub, announcements, and live notifications — only when requested. Stop; delivery/dispatch remains unimplemented. Historical Phase 10 evidence in EXAMS.md; details [HOMEWORK.md](HOMEWORK.md), next-session record [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).

Valid execution statuses: NOT STARTED, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED, COMPLETE. COMPLETE requires the phase's real acceptance evidence, not merely a generated implementation.

## Update contract

At each meaningful checkpoint replace the active summary with the current facts. Update the ledger only when evidence changes. Include actual command names after Phase 01 creates them. Link detailed evidence rather than accumulating long logs here.

A new user requirement should update DECISIONS.md and affected rules/phases, then be referenced here. Do not discard unresolved defects or mark failed checks skipped to close a phase.
